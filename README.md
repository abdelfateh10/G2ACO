**Unsupervised Graph Attention Autoencoder Clustering-Oriented (G2ACO)** is a lightweight and effective model for **community detection in attributed networks**. By combining graph attention mechanisms with an autoencoder framework and a clustering-oriented loss, G2ACO captures both topological and attribute information, guiding representation learning directly toward meaningful community assignments.

## Features

- üìä **Graph Attention Encoder**: Multi-head attention layers to learn expressive node embeddings.
- üîÑ **Inner-Product Decoder**: Reconstructs graph structure and node attributes.
- üß† **Clustering-Oriented Loss**: Integrates k-means as a target distribution loss for community detection.
- ‚ö° **Faster Runtime**:  Faster runtime.

## Requirements

```bash
python >=3.8
torch >=2.0.0
torch_geometric==2.4.0
numpy
scikit-learn
```



## Datasets

G2ACO has been evaluated on:

- **Citation Networks**: Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed
